Linux bash scripts
=============
! I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING !

Here you find some linux scripts written in bash for different uses. Feel free to use or optimize any script :)

### LogonScreen
A simple self-made script for a nice logon screen. It should be added in the .bashrc file to execute it automically on every login: `echo "bash /path/to/script/logonScreen.sh" >> ~/.bashrc`
